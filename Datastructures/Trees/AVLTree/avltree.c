/*
    Garett Roberts
    AVL Tree implementation

    Purpose:
       Tree's are more memory efficent, only using what is needed.
       They also are better for orginizing data (sorted)
       Keeps access time to log(n) always, the depth never exceeds what it needs to 

    Complexity:
        Time:          O(log(n)) for Access, Search, Insertion, and Deletion
        Space(memory): O(n)  

    Leaks:
